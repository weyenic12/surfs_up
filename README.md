## Overview of the Analysis
- We were given the task of finding the temperature data for the months of June and December in Oahu, in order to determine if the surf and ice cream shop business is sustainable year-round.

## Resources
- [June Temperature Data](/june_temps.PNG)
- [December Temperature Data](/dec_temps.PNG)
--------------------------
## Results
- By viewing the data in the tables above for the months of June and December, you would notice a few differences in the weather. For example, the average temperature in the month of June is about 75 degrees while it is only 71 in December. 
- Another difference in the data would be the amount of data entries each month has. June has 1700 entries from 2010-2017 while December only has 1517 entries for those years. There is no data for December after December 2016. With less amounts for December it could be skewing the data; however, we are still comparing six years of data to seven years of data so it would not be that skewed.
- A final difference between the two months, is the consistency of the weather. By looking at the data, you would notice that the months have similar "max" temperatures in 85 and 83. However, December has an eight degree cooler "min" temperature in 56 to June's 64. December has a higher standard deviation and a slightly greater range in the quartile ranges. This data shows that December has a higher variance in temperature.
--------------------------
## Summary
- In conclusion, there is not a drastic change in the temperature throughout the year in Oahu. Only a slight decline from the summer months to winter months of an average of 3 degrees. Some other queries that could be run would be to get other types of weather data other than temperature. You could try to find the trend in precipitation or tropical storms to see if that could impact the ice cream shop business. Another query that could be run could be testing the same data in other locations similar to Oahu to potentially see if another location would suit better for the business.
